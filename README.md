# .dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for Arch Linux. They are mostly productivity-focused and value function over form, but I think that they look quite decent.
I have split many program configuration files into directories to enable modularity.
Also, every program (or group of related programs) has its own tag, so users of these dotfiles can choose which features they want.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to the standard rcm dotfile location:  
   `git clone https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
2. Install with `cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh`

The first installation will launch an interactive tag-selection menu. Select tags according to your needs and preferences.
Automatic installation of dependencies is WIP.
